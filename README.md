# chargesPHP
Electric field line visualization simulation of point charges and finite line charges.

## Simulation
Uses electric field of point and finite line charge equation.

Finite line charge is not approximated using numerical integration.

Electric field lines however are approximated using Euler numerical integration with a constant step and maximum number of iterations.
